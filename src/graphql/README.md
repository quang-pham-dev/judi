# GraphQL Directory
The `graphql` directory is dedicated to managing all GraphQL-related operations within the project. It contains files that define the GraphQL schemas, queries, mutations, and other related configurations essential for communicating with the backend GraphQL server.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the graphql directory is to organize and centralize all GraphQL operations, making it easier for developers to manage data interactions between the client and the server. By structuring GraphQL operations in a single location, the project maintains better modularity, readability, and scalability. This approach also simplifies the maintenance and testing of GraphQL-related code.

## Contents (example)
- schema.graphql: Defines the GraphQL schema, including types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions that represent the data structure and operations available on the server.
- queries.ts: Contains all the GraphQL query operations used in the project. Each query is structured to fetch specific data from the backend.
- mutations.ts: Includes all the GraphQL mutation operations for creating, updating, or deleting data on the server.
- subscriptions.ts: Manages all the GraphQL subscription operations, allowing the client to listen to real-time updates from the server.
- fragments.ts: Stores reusable GraphQL fragments, which are predefined pieces of queries or mutations that can be included in other operations to avoid duplication and promote consistency.
- client.ts: Configures the Apollo Client or any other GraphQL client used in the project, including setting up the client instance, middleware, and connection settings.
Each file within the graphql directory is designed to encapsulate specific aspects of GraphQL operations, promoting code reusability, consistency, and ease of use across the project.

Feel free to explore each file for more details on its implementation and usage.
